                <p>Welcome to my website. I'm a Brazilian software developer based in Montréal, Canada.</p>
                <p>This is where I intend to post thoughts, tutorials, music reviews and anything else that might come up in my mind. When I first thought of writing a blog, the main idea consisted of writing reviews on every single CD I had back home. Then I actually thought it would be a total waste if I didn't also write about programming languages and technologies in general as a contribution, especially having acquired most of my knowledge from the online community.</p>
                <p>I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from FATEC (Brazil) in 2016, and did part of my program at York University (Toronto). During this exchange, I studied mostly academic English and Virtual Reality.
                    Back in Canada, I now call Montréal home, fell in love with the city, and have been learning French since then.</p>
                <p>Roughly speaking, my interests range from music (guitar, drums, production, novelties) to technology (programming languages, computers, microcontrollers, open-source), including even subway systems all around the world. Last but not least, Tim Hortons is a must. You will most likely see me post winter pics on
